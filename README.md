# CFGdegree2024
This repository is part of my CFG degree and my very first assignement!

# About me
🌱 I’m currently on the **Code First Girls Product Management Summer 2024 Degree**  and so grateful for the opportunity! I have also been learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Agile and Scrum.

✨ Ask me anything about languages, neurodivergence and Tech and crochet Arugami Star Wars characters!

💞️ I’m a career-switching teacher and a mature student. I won't tell my real age, but I ~~am an old Millenial~~ was born last century, as I like to tell my two children! I am a facilitator and an empath.
